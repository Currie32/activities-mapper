# Activities Mapper

A simple site to help you find things to do/eat/drink!

Hopefully you'll see it as a good resource to either:
- Build a [simple react app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
- Use a [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps)
- Sync with [Firebase Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics)
- Add a [Buy Me a Coffee Button](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/)
- Or whatever else you like about it!
